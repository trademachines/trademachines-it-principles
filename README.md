### Decoupled Architecture
### Avoid Complexity
### Monitor The Business
### Focus On Our Business
### Reactive Manifesto
Developing systems according to Reactive Manifesto (http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) allows us to create flexible, loosely-coupled and scalable applications.
Reactive Programming combined with Reactive Systems Design is a main tools for dealing with technical problems on backend which occurs when data and load is constantly growing and high availability is required.


## Design And Delivery

### Make Local Decision
Then promote them globally. We don't want to put more constraint on our teams than necessary.

### Measure All Things

### You Build It, You Run It
### API First
### Automate Everything
We keep reptitive work to a minimum and build automation into our tools whenever and wherever its feasible.

### Start With Plan A
We are bold and start with something that works right now. From there we inspect and adapt to our needs.

###  Challenge The Product Owner
We ask questions, because we don't want to follow blindly but find a balance between user value and technical feasibility.
