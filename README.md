## Strategic Goals

### Reduce Time To Market
We want to close our feedback loops as soon as possible. Therefore we deliver value to our users rather sooner than later.

### Assure Scalability
Our business grows fast, so we make sure that our infrastructure never becomes the bottleneck.

### Practice Independent (yet Guided Approach) - Talented People
We know why we do things, we decide how to approach them and deliberately practice our skills.

### Take/Make Data Driven Decisions
We base our decisions on data rather than beliefs.

### Measure Cost Efficiency
Find the correct balance between cost and value.

### Care About Our Customers
Our success depends on our clients' happiness. We feel responsible for providing quality outcome, even though we don't have direct contact with customer.

And then find something that works.
###  Challenge The Product Owner
We ask questions, because we don't want to follow blindly but find a balance between user value and technical feasibility.
