## Strategic Goals

### Reduce Time To Market
[We want to close our feedback loops as soon as possible. Therefore we deliver value to our users rather sooner than later.]
-- needs rephrasing

### Scale for Next Step
Our business keeps growing, so we make sure that our infrastructure is always one step ahead of sales/business.

### Make Data Driven Decisions
We base our decisions on data rather than beliefs.

### Aim for Cost Efficiency
Find the correct balance between cost and value.

### Care About Our Customers
We feel responsible for our clients' happiness.

### Constantly learning
We don't know everything. That's why constantly learning is important to us.
